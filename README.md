# Tech stack

1. Database: I am using an OVH VPS server that is hosting postgres inside of a docker container
2. AWS: Otherwise I use AWS for site hosting and all other things, I've learned a lot about AWS.

This is a monorepo that uses SST to interface with AWS.

Drizzle is used to interface with my postgres database.

Mapbox and ReactMapGL are used as the mapping solution.
